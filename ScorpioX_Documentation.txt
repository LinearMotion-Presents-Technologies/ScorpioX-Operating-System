    The ScorpioX Operating System, Developed By LinearMotion Presents & Technologies Directed
By Arbab Laiq Ahmed From Peshawar, Pakistan.

ABOUT:
    This is just a basic Operating System having the Fundamental Concepts of Operating System
Development. One can take a look at it and can take concept from it, like how can one setup a program, or can also create Operating System Architecture based on this Operating System.

HOW TO USE:
    SYNOPSIS:
        COMMANDS:

        help:-      Shows Help, Mentions Commands That You Can Use.
        cpuId:-     Shows CPU Specs, Such As Processor Version, Frequency And Much More.
        MemoryMap:- Shows The Map Of The Memory, Such as Blocks Of Memory etc(For Experts Only)
        UserMem:-   Shows Details About Disk Memory That Can Be Used By Any User.
        mouseInit:- Enables Mouse Functionality(Mouse Can Be Enabled Once).
        powerLow:-  Shutdowns The System (This Command Can Be Used In Emulators Only).
        echo:-      Simply Prints Whatever You Write With it, Like This: echo "Hello". "Hello"
                    Will Get Printed.
        credits:-   Shows Some Information About Developer.
        clrscr:-    This Command Simply Clears The Screen (Clears The Previous Commands).
        FPUInfo:-   This Command Gives Information About FPU(For Experts Only).
        Stop:-      If You've Enabled The Mouse And You Want To Disable That, Simply Right
                    Click Any Where On The Screen And Type "Stop" Command, Mouse Will Get Disabled.
        WriteMode:- This Command Is Used To Write Data To The SATA Drive, It Will Take ID Of
                    The Data, Name(In Double Quotes), And Finally Data Itself(In Double Quotes)
        ReadMode:-  This Command Is Used To Read Data From SATA Drive, It Will Take Only ID Of
                    The Data(You Can Write More Data, But You Can Only Read Last Written Data)
    Administrator:- This Command Gives Access To The Administrator Mode. It Will Require A
                    Password To Access Admin Mode, The Password Is "ArbabAhmed"(Without Quote)
                    Then, One Thing That Need To Be Mentioned Is That Administrator Will Have
                    More Commands, So Once Admin Mode Is Enabled, Then You Can Use The Following Commands:

ADMINISTRATOR MODE COMMANDS:

    help:-      Shows Help, Mentions Commands That Administrator Can Use.
    KernelMem:- Admin Has The Right To Check That How Much Memory Kernel Is Consuming.(Also
                Type), Like What Kind Of Data Is It Using.
    PagingArch:-This Command Is Basically For The Implementation Of Kernel Paging Concept,
                But Due To Absence Of FileSystem Such As FAT32 Or NTFS, Its Functionality
                Is To Restart The System.
    AccessBIOS:-This Command Is Used To Initialize BIOS Of Our Operating System.
    PowerUser:- This Command And SuperUser Command Doesn't Do Anything Yet, Just Prints
                "You Are Now A SuperUser" And "You Are Now A PowerUser".
    exitAdmin:- This Command Is Used To Exit The Administrator Mode.


            So These Were All Commands That I Explained. Now I Also Have Some Bugs Technical
Bugs In The Code, That I Will Try My Best To Fix In The Near Future. So Now Let Me Mention
The Bugs.

BUGS:
    1. powerLow Command Only Works With Emulators, It Turns Off The Emulators Such As QEMU
        And VirtualBox Effectively, But Doesn't Work When On Proper WorkStation. So In Next
        Update By The Grace Of Almighty I Will Fix This Bug.

    2. mouseInit Command Initializes The Mouse Once, After That If You Disable The Mouse
        And Again You Want To Enable That, It Won't Do That, So I Will Try My Best To Fix That As Well.

    3. In WriteMode We Can Write A Lot Of Data To The SATA, But In The ReadMode We Can Just
        Read The Last Written Data, Just Like A Stack, But Unlike Stack We Cannot Access Other
        Data(Just Last Written Data).

            So These Are 3 Bugs That Will Get Fixed In The Next Update.

ADVANCEMENTS:
        Now I Am Also Thinking About Introducing Some More Functionality To This Operating
    System. So, The Functionalities That Will Be Introduced In This ScoprioX Operating
    System's Next Update Are:

        1. FileSystem:- I'll Introduce FileSystem So That We Become Able To Directly Access
            Files Using Their Names. Also We Will Be Able To Find, Delete, Replace Files.

        2. Complete Kernel Paging:- Using Kernel Paging Will Make Us Able To Store More Data On
            The SATA Than The Physical Size Of SATA We Have.(More Data Less Space Consumption Functionality).

        3. Games:- I'll Introduce Few Games In This Operating System, So That It Can Also
            Be Used For Entertainment Purposes.

TERMS & PRIVACY:
    You Can Use This Operating System In The Way You Want.
